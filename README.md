# Types of Analytics

## Finance Analytics

We need to generate individual product sales, aggregated on a monthly basis, for the Croma India customer in FY 2021. This will help track individual product sales performance. The report would contain:
- Month
- Product Name
- Variant
- Sold Quantity
- Gross Price

## Market Analytics

Create a report for the top market and top customer by net sales for a given financial year. This will help us have a holistic view of the trends and take required actions.

## Supply Chain Analytics

Create an aggregate forecast accuracy report for all customers in a given fiscal year. Doing this will allow us to track the accuracy of the forecasts we make for a given customer.
